                          <span class="first_letter">N</span>early 100 years since the end of the Austro-Hungarian 
                          Empire,and the last time the world heard from Carl Suchy & Söhne, Austria’s foremost name 
                          in luxury watchmaking. Given the amount of time that’s passed, and the abject scarcity of 
                          surviving examples upon which to prove such a legacy even existed, this might as well 
                          be a fresh brand launch.
                       </p>
                        <p>
                            That matters little, though, as the revival of the brand is a welcome one, especially when its debut release,
                            the Carl Suchy & Söhne Waltz No. 1 watch manages to marry beautiful design, fine watchmaking signatures, 
                            and exclusivity with a surprising degree of affordability – so much so, that we had to confirm pricing twice 
                            just to be sure.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Just like the dance from which the watch derives its inspiration, the Carl Suchy & Söhne Waltz No. 1 is a 
                            clinic in cohesion and classic design fluidity. Its most immediately apparent signature is the striking guilloché
                            pattern on the dial, which is divided in half by vertical and horizontal striping, like two dancers rotating in 
                            a contra-body movement (or "CBM" in ballroom-speak), typical of ballroom classics like the Foxtrot, the Tango, 
                            and of course, the Waltz. The rotating small seconds indicator at 6:00 is cut out of the same CBM-inspired striping,
                            and is thus aligned with the rest of the dial as it waltzes in a perfect circle once per minute.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            The rest of the dial carries similar fluidity – from the curvature of the sapphire crystal which matches the 
                            side profile of the 41mm (30m-water-resistant) case, to the sleek integrated lugs, and my favorite 
                            part: the applied minute and hour indices – the latter of which are set into the dial itself and curved 
                            upward to match the slope of the rehaut as it meets the baseband. Despite all the striping on the dial, 
                            the effect is subtle, but oozes pure minimalism – a theme which is consistently repeated throughout the watch
                            to great effect. It should come as little surprise that the design language itself was inspired by the work 
                            of Adolf Loos, a prolific Austrian architect from the early 20th century, renowned for mixing minimalism with
                            modern innovations.

                            Resurrecting the long-dormant Carl Suchy & Söhne name and bringing the Waltz No. 1 to life was a collaborative 
                            effort of sorts, between Marc Jenni of the AHCI (the Académie Horlogère des Créateurs Indépendants – a membership
                            of the top independent watchmakers in the world), designers Reinhard Steger

                              so for the simple but attractive Vaucher VMF 5401 movement (50 hours of power reserve) in the Carl
                               Suchy & Söhne Waltz No. 1. In this case, the Vaucher touch is (figuratively) written all over the 
                               view through the Carl Suchy & Söhne Waltz No. 1’s exhibition caseback where, for instance, 
                               the micro-rotor is expertly finished with the same perpendicular vertical and horizontal striping 
                               as found on the dial.

                              The [     ] Carl Suchy & Söhne Waltz No. 1 will be presented in four variants with two dial colors
                               (black and white) and two case finishes (stainless steel and black) – but the catch is that only 22
                                pieces will be made, starting at a price of 5,900 euros, which we’d argue is a paltry sum, given 
                                the level of finishing and exclusivity found on this triumphant revival of Austrian watchmaking.
